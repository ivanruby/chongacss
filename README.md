chongaCSS
=========

A CSS Framework. Easy to use and Beautiful. Chonga.


Description
===========

A (tentative) **language-agnostic**, **intuitive** and **lightweight** CSS code should not be difficult to attain.
This is a proof-of-concept project, attempting to deviate from the English-speaking standard of existent frameworks but keeping *interoperability* and *maintanability* in mind.


Initial features:
================

- Frequent styles (positioning and spacing) (v0.1 ?)
- Grids or a way of building the page structure/layout (v0.2 ?)
- Widgets: dropdown menus, image carousels and others (v0.3 ?)
- Effects: tooltips, ribbons, shadows, etc (v0.4 ?)


ChongaCSS is a bilingual framework, i.e., class names will be in English and Portuguese.
Although possible, inclunding other languages can prove to be impractical due to its effects on the file size. Solutions to implement other languages dynamically can be studied.
