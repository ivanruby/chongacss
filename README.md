chongaCSS
=========

A CSS Framework. Easy to use and Beautiful. Chonga.


Description
===========

A (tentative) **language-agnostic**, **intuitive** and **lightweight** CSS code should not be difficult to attain.
This is a proof-of-concept project, attempting to deviate from the English-speaking standard of existent frameworks but keeping *interoperability* and *maintanability* in mind.


Initial features:
================

- Frequent styles (positioning and spacing) (v0.1 ?)
- Grids or a way of building the page structure/layout (v0.2 ?)
- Widgets: dropdown menus, image carousels and others (v0.3 ?)
- Effects: tooltips, ribbons, shadows, etc (v0.4 ?)


The framework will be bilingual, i.e., class names will be in English and Portuguese.
